## Question and Answers

* **Question**: What is this library?
  * **Answer**: This is meant to be an "entry point" for all the libraries listed in the [dependencies section](#dependencies); the purpose of this library is to ensure that the dependencies are compatible/work with each other, and reduce duplicated code.<br><br>
* **Question**: honey, why not just put everything into one big monorepo? this seems unnecessarily messy idk
  * **Answer**: i agree sm ðŸ˜­, however i do not have the knowledge and resources required to create and maintain a monorepo that has multiple languages (e.g. swift/c++/objc/typescript), and packagers (e.g. npm/cocoapods/SPM); this is the best i can do for now sorry<br><br>
* **Question**: ok, i understand; are there at least any benefits of separating the dependencies out?
  * **Answer**: yeahâ€”although it's a versioning and maintenance nightmareâ€”I am at least able to create an example for each library so i can test if they're working or not, while at the same time making sure that a bug is caused either by RN weirdness or from `UIKit`.<br><br>
* **Question**: Why use this library, instead of directly using the dependencies?
  * **Answer**: The libraries listed in the [dependencies section](#dependencies) have different versions, and it's kind of hard to keep track which libraries are compatible with each other; using this "wrapper" library instead makes sure the correct version for all the dependencies is installed. 
  * Although i try my best to follow the "semantic versioning" guidelines, i make mistakes sometimes, and introduce breaking changes accidentally; this causes a cascade/domino effect where i unknowingly break the other libraries.
